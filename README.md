# Stop Points Extraction Algorithm for Ships Trajectories

Given a set of AIS geo-spatial data enriched with meta - data like speed and mmsi the algorithm calculates the stops point. Usually stop points for ships are near ports and they can be used for segmenting a time - based trip or an unordered set of points into meaningful stop - to - stop trajectories. An example can be found bellow.
